Apologies for the confusion earlier. The code I provided will transfer files using multiple threads, but it doesn't guarantee that exactly 6 files will be transferred at a time. The number of files transferred simultaneously depends on how many files are present in the directory and how many threads are available for execution.

If you want to ensure that exactly 6 files are transferred at a time, you can use a thread pool approach, where you maintain a fixed number of worker threads that process a batch of files concurrently. Here's a modified version of the code that implements a thread pool to transfer 6 files at a time:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <dirent.h>
#include <string.h>

#define NUM_THREADS 6
#define PATH_TO_FILES "/path/to/files/"  // Replace with your path

pthread_mutex_t mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
pthread_cond_t cond = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;
int file_index = 0;
int num_files = 0;

void *transfer_file(void *filename) {
    char *file = (char *)filename;
    // Replace this with actual file transfer code
    printf("Transferring file: %s\n", file);
    pthread_exit(NULL);
}

void *thread_worker(void *arg) {
    while (1) {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
        while (file_index >= num_files) {
            pthread_cond_wait(&cond, &mutex);
        }
        char *filename = ((char **)arg)[file_index];
        file_index++;
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);

        if (filename == NULL) {
            break;
        }

        transfer_file(filename);
        free(filename);
    }
    pthread_exit(NULL);
}

int main() {
    DIR *dir;
    struct dirent *entry;

    dir = opendir(PATH_TO_FILES);
    if (dir == NULL) {
        perror("Unable to open directory");
        return 1;
    }

    char **filenames = malloc(sizeof(char *) * NUM_THREADS);

    while ((entry = readdir(dir)) != NULL) {
        if (entry->d_type == DT_REG) {  // Regular files only
            char *filename = entry->d_name;
            filenames[num_files] = malloc(strlen(filename) + 1);
            strcpy(filenames[num_files], filename);
            num_files++;
            if (num_files >= NUM_THREADS) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    closedir(dir);

    pthread_t threads[NUM_THREADS];
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
        pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, thread_worker, filenames);
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
        pthread_join(threads[i], NULL);
    }

    printf("All files transferred.\n");

    free(filenames);

    return 0;
}
```

In this code, the `thread_worker` function is responsible for processing files using a thread pool approach. It waits for a signal indicating that there are files to be processed, and it transfers files until there are no more files left.

Please replace `/path/to/files/` with the actual path where your files are located.
